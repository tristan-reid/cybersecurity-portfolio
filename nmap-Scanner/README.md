In this project I wrote a Python script that creates an nmap wrapper. This project taught me how nmap works reconassiance,
through performing an nmap scan on nmap's website as the host. I learned how to write code that prints the necessary information
on the host (host address, host state, ports, port states, etc.), and how to run the script on bash.
